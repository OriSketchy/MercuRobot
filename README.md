Hi! I'm Ori and welcome to the github repository for my first ever game, MercuRobot!

Let me preface this by saying:
I'm not a programmer, I'm an artist with only a very vague idea of what I'm doing.
I'm using a lot of unity tutorials I find around internet and enlisting the help of my dad and my brother (who are a programmer and a programming student) to make everything work as smoothly as I can make it so the coding work isn't entirely mine. People I took big chunks of code from will, obviously, be credited in the final game.

Below is a link to a google drive folder containing the various builds of my game. I'll be updating it with new builds every time there's a significant change and I'll also be making the final build available in this folder for free for anyone to download and tinker with.

If you play any of the builds please fill out this form:

It's very short, won't take up a lot of your time, and will help me immensely with the development of this and future games. Be as honest as you can! Please remember that this is my first ever game so any constructive criticism is not only welcome but encouraged!
If you find any bugs, possible bug fixes, or in general anything that could be improved please let me know! One of the main reasons I set up this public repository is to hopefully get some suggestions from folks way more skilled than I am!

I have an instagram and a youtube where I'm currently housing my devlog while I get an actual blogging section on my new site set up.
